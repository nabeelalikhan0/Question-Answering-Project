# 📄 File-Based Chatbot with Google Gemini

This project is a Django web application that allows you to **upload a file** (TXT, PDF, DOCX), extract its text, and then **chat with a chatbot** powered by **Google Gemini** — with the conversation based entirely on the uploaded file’s content.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📂 **Upload Files**: Supports `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.docx` and `more`formats.
- 🧠 **Text Extraction**: Automatically reads and processes file content.
- 💬 **Interactive Chat**: Ask questions and receive answers **only** from your uploaded file.
- 🔄 **Persistent Context**: The chatbot remembers your uploaded file during the session.
- 🖥 **User-Friendly Interface**: File upload + chat input on the same page.
